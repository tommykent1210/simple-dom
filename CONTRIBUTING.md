I prefer to use the [GitHub Flow][github-flow] for working. So please submit a PR with your proposed changes stating the case for adding the changes with any documentation and tests that are appropriate.

This library aims to adhere to [PSR-1][psr-1], [PSR-2][psr-2] and [PSR-4][psr-4] standards so please make sure contributions adhere to those standards too. Also, if you spot any existing violations of those standards, PRs to fix them are most welcome.
